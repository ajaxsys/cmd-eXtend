2  Windows 7 local shortcuts "do you want to open this file" warning 
Simple solution:
it does seem stupid, but so is windows 7;
instead of copying the link from anywhere to the quick launch bar,
make a link on your desktop, rename it as you want and then drag and drop holding the shift button so it will move the link.
Like that, windows already know the source of the link and won't tag it like potentially dangerous.






3 Windows Explorer Defaults to Libraries Folder in Windows 7

To change the startup folder to (My) Computer, use this target path:
explorer.exe ::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}

Where the GUID {20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D} represents the My Computer folder.

For Documents folder, use this target path:
explorer.exe ::{450D8FBA-AD25-11D0-98A8-0800361B1103}

You may also suffix the full path instead of using GUID. For example,
explorer.exe D:\Scripts
